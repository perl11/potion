(%% Clearly, you and I should be up there.
We should be the hosts of this banquet.
I'd press the elevator button for people
And clean the crab legs and you'd help me.

%% I'll bet the staff just lives upstairs,
Heck, all we'd need is a bunk bed.
I could pick out what the waitresses wear and,
After that, I'd come find you and take a break.
