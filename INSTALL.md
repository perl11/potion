# ~ building potion ~

Normally

    $ make

To build with debugging symbols

    $ make DEBUG=1

To build without JIT

    $ make JIT=0

Lastly, to verify your build

    $ make test

On a typical GNU make < 4.0 sometimes the `test/classes/creatures/` fails.
Try `make -j1 test` or gmake-4.0 then.

## ~ the latest potion ~

To build the bleeding edge, you will need
GNU make, binutils, perl, sed, git and gcc or better clang.
clang produces better code than gcc, but is harder to debug.
gcc-4.6.3 is broken, at least on ubuntu.

    $ git clone git://github.com/perl11/potion.git
    $ cd potion
    $ git submodule update --init
    $ make

## ~ external dependencies ~

    build-time: gnu make, perl, sed, gcc or clang, echo, cat, expr, git, rsync
    perl is only needed because of BSD/darwin sed problems

    run-time:
    libuv (later: pcre, libtomath) is included, but external
    should choose to use existing packages. see `dist.mak`

    optional:

    libudis on x86 (debugging only)
      http://udis86.sourceforge.net/ x86 16,32,64 bit
      port install udis86

    libdistorm64 on x86 (debugging only)
      http://ragestorm.net/distorm/ x86 16,32,64 bit with all intel/amd extensions
      apt-get install libdistorm64-dev

    libdisasm on i386 (debugging only)
      http://bastard.sourceforge.net/libdisasm.html 386 32bit only
      apt-get install libdisasm-dev

    sloccount (for make sloc)
      apt-get install sloccount

    redcloth (for make doc install)
      apt-get install ruby-redcloth, or
      port install rb-redcloth

    doxygen 1.8 or 1.9 (for make doc install)
      apt-get install doxygen, or
      port install doxygen

    GNU global (for make docall install)
      apt-get install global, or
      port install global

## ~ sandboxing ~

With `gmake SANDBOX=1` a static sandboxed `bin/potion-s` is built, which
excludes all local filesystem and process accesses and includes all external
modules in one executable. `load` is also disabled, so modules must include
all dependent libraries.

Network access is enabled via Aio. If you want to disable
networking also, remove `lib/aio.c` from the SANDBOX SRC in `Makefile`,
and `Potion_Init_aio(P)` from `core/internal.c`

## ~ installing ~

    $ sudo make install

## ~ building on windows ~

Potion's win32 binaries are built using MinGW.
<http://mingw.org/>

It's a bit hard to setup mingw and gmake on Windows.
I usually run a shell under Cygwin and add MinGW
to my `$PATH`.

Once that's all done,

    $ make

The easiest way to do this, actually, is on Linux or Darwin.
On Ubuntu, if you have MinGW installed,

    $ make clean; make core/syntax.c
    $ make config CC=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc CROSS=1
    $ touch core/syntax.c
    $ make && make dist

This will first create a native greg and `core/syntax.c`,
sets `CROSS=1` and cross-compile with the given CC.
See `tools/mk-release.sh`

`make test` will not work, you need to copy a make dist tarball
to the machine and test it there.

win64 is not supported yet. It uses a slighlty different ABI,
cygwin64 misses pthread\_barrier\_t.
and x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc fails by creating a wrong `config.h`

## ~ building on bsd ~

BSD make is not supported.
You can either install gnu make (gmake)

    $ sudo port install gmake

or try `./configure` which creates a special BSD `config.mk`

or try to merge `master` with the branch `bsd`

    $ git merge bsd
    ... resolve conflicts, or not

## ~ building with a strict C++ compiler ~

potion does not support strict C++ compilers.
If you have no modern C compiler:

Either add a C dialect to CC in config.inc (i.e. `-std=c89`),

    g++ --help=C; clang++ -x C -std=gnu89

or try to merge with the branch `p2-c++`.

## ~ creating documentation ~

This is required for `make dist` and release admins.
You'll need:

    redcloth to convert .textile to html,
    doxygen (1.8 or 1.9), and
    GNU global for gtags and htags

On windows et al.: `gem install RedCloth`
