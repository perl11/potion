  ~ building potion ~

  Normally,

    $ make

  To build with debugging symbols,

    $ make DEBUG=1

  To build with the JIT off,

    $ make JIT=0

  Lastly, to verify your build,

    $ make test


  ~ the latest potion ~

  To build the bleeding edge, you will need
  make, binutils and gcc.

    $ git clone git://github.com/why/potion.git
    $ cd potion
    $ make


  ~ installing ~

  Since Potion is only a single binary right now
  and there's no additional libs, I haven't written
  an installation step yet.


  ~ building on windows ~

  Potion's win32 binaries are built using MinGW.
  <http://mingw.org/>

  It's a bit hard to setup mingw and make on Windows.
  I usually run a shell under Cygwin and add MinGW
  to my $PATH.

  Once that's all done,

    $ make

  The easiest way to do this, actually, is on Linux.

  On Ubuntu, if you have MinGW installed,

    $ make CC=i586-mingw32msvc-gcc

  You may then rename `potion` to `potion.exe` and
  donate that binary to the needy.
