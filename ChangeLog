        * Added a reduce method to tuple. (Peter Arthur)
        * Added a database library as sqlite3 binding. (Peter Arthur)
        * Fix installation from source without git
        * Fixed various SEGVs and minor errors and security issues.

v0.3	Sat Oct 17 10:42:49 CEST 2015 rurban v0.3-g7963cbc-1264

	* Added new syntax tuple[index] for fast, unsafe array access,
	also for table with a string literal: table["key"]
	* Fixed comparison and equalness esp. for numbers. Check now also double
        values, before only int. All values are now compared strictly, numeric types
        are not promoted to match. i.e 0 != 0.0
	The jit now requires at least a x86 with sse2 (Pentium 4).
	* Changed the name Decimal in the API to Double
	* Promote integer to double on arithmetic overflow (gcc-5, clang-3.6 or a
        single jo insn in the jit)
	* Added seperate Double and Integer vtables, which are both of kind Number.
	Added specialized methods.
	* Added isa? and subclass? methods, re-enabled test/classes/creature.pn
	* string: improve performance of at and ord
	* Added more examples
	* Updated libuv from 0.11.23 to 1.0.0
        * New syntax error: Call empty message
	* Fixed size method for objects and primitives
	* Added parent and methods methods to the Lobby (Peter Arthur)

v0.2	Thu Sep 11 10:28:32 CDT 2014 rurban v0.2-0-ga280506-1153

        * print and say methods return "" instead of nil.
        * Added methods for table: clone, slice, keys, values.
	For tuple: slice. For bytes and string: clone.
	* Added support for negative arguments for string.slice
	* Changed API's for potion_type_error_want
	* Updated libuv from 0.11.14 to 0.11.23
	* Fixed uv_buf_t handling in aio
	* Added SANDBOX support: make SANDBOX=1
	  omit access to local filesystem, processes, loading shared libraries
	  -L, and external compilers. bin/potion-s includes all modules statically.
	  See INSTALL.md
        * Added rudimentary src debugger with -d (unfinished, c-version only)
        * parse extern functions, but args are not yet translated (unfinished)
        * Added typed function calls with compile-time binding (experimental)
        * Fixed GC stability issues

v0.1	Wed Oct 16 13:08:38 2013 rurban v0.1-0-gead95d2-1061

        * Asynchronous non-blocking IO in the aio module via libuv. So like
        node, but potion is a bit faster then node.
        * Buffered stream FILE* IO in the buffile module.
        * Optional and default signature arguments.
        * Added argv tuple
        * Added cmdline args: -e,-D?,-L,-d,-c,--check
        * More examples and documentation
        * Fixed various jit-x86 limitations on max number of stack variables,
        eg. max 15 on amd64
        * Fixed GC errors when running out of memory
        * Added support for 3 -DJ disassemblers
        * Changed dir layout, seperate bin and lib/potion, use .y for syntax
        * Improved build system (PIC and static, faster auto-configure, ...)
        * Use Travis testing
        * khash.h updated to 0.2.6
        * greg updated to 0.4.5 with error blocks, lineno, -DPp support
        * Various minor fixes and new methods (sort, cmp, remove, delete,
