See the "pamphlet":start.html for an overview of the potion syntax and data structures.

- <a name="tuple">tuple</a> := an ordered list

- <a name="table">table</a> := a hash

- <a name="lick">lick</a> :=  a nested data structure, i.e. named hash. the keys are called @path@.

Every lick can have a name, a table of attributes, and a list of
children. The list of children can, instead, be a Potion data
type, such as a number or string or something.

- <a name="path">path</a> :=  key of a @lick@, an instance variable of an object.

Paths cannot be randomly added to the object after the object
is created. Each object has a strict set of paths. Every path
which is used in the constructor is added to the object upon
creation.

- <a name="upvalue">upvalue</a> := A variable in an upper scope.

Since a closure doesn't have access to the registers
of another function, these variables are passed
as pointers (the @PNWeakRef@ struct.)

- <a name="lobby">Lobby</a> := potion named the main interp object @Lobby@, which holds the
methods @about@, @here@, @exit@, @self@, ...
p2 renames it to @"P2"@

- <a name="mop">mop</a> := potion/p2 uses the "cola mop":http://piumarta.com/software/cola/objmodel2.pdf
with 5 core functions: @addMethod@, @lookup@, @allocate@, @delegated@ and @intern@.
And 4 native (and jitted) VM ops: @SELF@, @CLASS@, @BIND@ and @MESSAGE@.
